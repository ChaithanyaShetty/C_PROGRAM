ASSIGNMENT ON LOOPS(24-03-2023 - 13-03-2025)


1) Write a program to print all odd numbers and even numbers between two given numbers. print odd numbers in one loop and even in another loop after that.

2) Read the marks of n students and count how many of them scored above 80% and print the count.

3) Write a program to input a number and count the digits in it.
Eg.
0 - number of digits 1
12 – number of digits 2
155 – number of digits 3

4) Write a program to input a number and print the sum of the digits of the number.
Eg., 
0 - sum of the digits 0
12 - sum of the digits 3
155 - sum of the digits 11

5) Modify the Calculator Program to take input and perform the chosen operation. After each input and output, check if the user wants to continue. if the user does not choose n, then ask for input again. if user chooses n, then stop the loop.

6)  Modify the Calculator Program to take input and perform the chosen operation. If the user chooses one of the operations, +,-,*,/ and % then show the output and continue for next iteration.
If the user chooses wrong operation, then stop the loop.

7)  Write a program to find out if an integer entered by a user is a prime number or not. Count the factors of the given number to identify prime number.

Hint: A prime number has only 2 factors, 1 and itself.

8) Write a program to find the quotient and reminder of two given numbers upon division, without using / and % operators.

eg.,
8 3
quotient : 2 ( without using /)
remainder : 2 (without using %)

Hint: Division is continuous subtraction until the reminder is smaller than the devisor.

9) find the sum of n numbers entered by the user. Also, print the sum of positive numbers and negative numbers seperately.

10) Find the sum of numbers entered by the user, as long as the user enters positive numbers. Stop the process when the user enters a negative number (dont add negative number).

11) Find the sum of n positive numbers entered by the user. If the user enters, negative number, dont add it, ask for another positive number instead.
